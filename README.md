# Lane Detection (Notebook)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a **classical computer vision pipeline** for **lane detection**. It parses images or video frames, enhances lane markings, and draws detected lane lines/areas using traditional techniques (no deep learning required).

## Features

- **Techniques used:** Canny, Gaussian Blur, Hough Transform, ROI Masking, Sliding Window Polynomial Fit
- **Key functions:** average_slope_intercept, canny, display_lines, display_lines_average, houghLines, make_points, region_of_interest
- **Dataset/files referenced:** /content/test1.mp4

## Requirements

- cv2
- google
- numpy

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.10+ and Jupyter.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or approximate minimal set:
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook lane_detection.ipynb
   ```

## How It Works

The pipeline typically includes:
1. **Preprocessing**: resize, color conversion (BGR↔HLS/HSV), and denoising (e.g., Gaussian blur).
2. **Edge/Color Extraction**: Canny/Sobel edges and/or color thresholding to isolate lane pixels.
3. **Region of Interest (ROI)**: polygon mask focusing on road area.
4. **Line/Area Detection**: e.g., Hough transform for line segments or sliding-window polynomial fit for lane area.
5. **Post-processing & Overlay**: draw lines/polylines or filled polygons on the original frame.

## Results

- The notebook renders images/frames with detected lane lines or filled lane area.
- For videos, frames can be processed sequentially (if implemented) and saved back to disk.
- See output samples generated by `cv2.imwrite(...)` if present.

## Roadmap / Improvements

- Handle shadows/lighting variations more robustly (adaptive thresholds).
- Add perspective transform (bird’s-eye) & curvature estimation if not present.
- Implement video pipeline with frame smoothing/tracking.
- Package core logic into Python module for reuse and unit tests.
